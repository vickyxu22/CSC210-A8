I did my best to complete this assignment, and the game runs smoothly for the most part. However, it's unable to update the learned animals and self-update within a given round. I don't have prior familiarity with PrintWriter output, so I wish we could learn these materials in class before delving into assignments. Testing repeatedly to find issues that don't work well has been quite a struggle for me.
